            Once upon a time, there was a boy named James. He always got pushed around. One day, a
            wizard appeared in front of the boy. The wizard gave James three wishes. One of James
            wishes was that tge wizard could make James go away. The next day James tried to make a
            wish, but he found himself to be in the land of the forgotten.

                He biggest trend in frontend user interface (UI) development for the web in recent
                years has been towards components. The React library, although by no means the
                first, has in large part established patterns for building UIs out of well specified
                component parts.
              </p>
              <p style={pStyle}>
                Of course, the trend toward software built from smaller pieces that perform a
                well-specified role is nothing new; modularization has been one of the key tenets of
                software engineering since long before I learned the concepts of “coupling and
                cohesion”.
              </p>
              <p style={pStyle}>
                Using the explorer you can test a given component in all the states that have been
                defined to be important. This isolation is key in enabling a workflow where you
                build one component at a time.
              </p>
              <p style={pStyle}>
                Adding a component to an explorer is typically as simple as programmatically
                enumerating the interesting states (in React this is the props and context of that
                component). This may be familiar to you — enumerating states is exactly how you do
                snapshot testing or screenshot testing (and it’s no surprise to see features that
                combine the above with component explorers).
              </p>
              <p style={pStyle}>
                Once you have detailed the interesting states of a component, you can exhaustively
                visually test the component with just a few clicks. Learn more about component
                explorers below.
